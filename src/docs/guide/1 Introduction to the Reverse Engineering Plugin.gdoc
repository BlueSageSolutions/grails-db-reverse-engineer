The Reverse Engineering plugin reads database table information using JDBC and uses the schema data to create domain classes. This is a complex problem and the plugin is unlikely to get things 100% correct. But it should save you a lot of work and hopefully not require too much tweaking after the domain classes are generated.

The plugin uses the [Hibernate Tools|http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/tools.html] library, with custom code to generate GORM domain classes instead of Java POJOs.
